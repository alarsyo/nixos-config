#+title: NixOS configurations

Configuration for my computers! You may find here system configurations for
various services I host, as well as my dotfiles for daily programs.

** Packages

Various packages of mine can be found in this repo. You can easily use these
packages from Nix by [[https://github.com/nix-community/NUR][setting up the Nix User Repository]].

*** Flake

If you prefer, theses packages are also exposed as a *flake* in this repo:

- To list packages:

#+begin_src sh
nix flake show
#+end_src

- To install one of them:

#+begin_src sh
nix build github:alarsyo/nixos-config#$PACKAGE
#+end_src
